This is very simple library for Wiring/Arduino interfacing 74HC595 class chip.
The chip is connected to 3 pins of Arduino.  These are:
 * clockPin -- which is connected to pin 11 (SRCLK) of the chip
 * dataPin  -- which is connected to pin 14 (SER) of the chip
 * latchPin -- which is connected to pin 12 (RCLK) of the chip

The interface cant talk only to one HC595 chip.  Remember, this is
first, quick, version of the library.
